Python code to change a O3 lidar data file into a HDF4 file for GEOMS.


Since the GEOMS variables name are very long, it is necessary to install the fork of the python-hdf4 library that accounts for extended variables.
This fork is located at:
https://github.com/fhs/python-hdf4/


The variable names for the O3 lidar are found on:
https://avdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.php?site=455555165#GEOMS-TE-LIDAR-O3-VA

The quality assurance can be found on:

It is greatly suggested to check your file against it, and ask help from the administrator if e.g. the PI/station name is not on the standard list.

Example of h5 to hdf4 conversion:
./commonH5tondaac.py TOLNet-O3_LMOL_20170801_R0.h5 GEOMS-LIDAR-O3-005-LMOL.txt

**********************************************


commonH5tondaac.py : reads a H5 file (Sullivan/Gronoff common format for the 2017 OWLETS campaign) along with a GEOMs file and returns the NDACC hdf4
commonTOLNETtondaac.py : (Work in progress) reads a TOLNET ascii file  along with a GEOMs file and returns the NDACC hdf4



readhd4.py   : Test file to read a O3 lidar hdf file

write_ndacc_HDF.py : Main file for reading the GEOMS file and writing the HDF file
