Python code to change a O3 lidar data file into a HDF4 file for GEOMS.


Since the GEOMS variables name are very long, it is necessary to install the fork of the python-hdf4 library that accounts for extended variables.
This fork is located at:
https://github.com/fhs/python-hdf4/


The variable names for the O3 lidar are found on:
https://avdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.php?site=455555165#GEOMS-TE-LIDAR-O3-VA

The quality assurance can be found on:
https://avdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.php?site=1829327959
It is greatly suggested to check your file against it, and ask help from the administrator if e.g. the PI/station name is not on the standard list.

Example of h5 to hdf4 conversion:

./commonH5tondaac.py TestFiles/owlets-CBBT-LMOL_LaRC-Lidar_20170719_R0.h5 TestFiles/GEOMS-LIDAR-O3-005-redacted.txt 
The "groundbased" file should pass the GEOMS checks.
The GEOMS-LIDAR file should be modified accordingly to the station.
The GEOMS-LIDAR file given as an example is optimized for a curtain, and not for a single profile.


Using a TOLnet common ASCII file and a GEOMS file:
./commonTOLNETtondaac.py TestFiles/TOLNet-O3Lidar_LaRC_20160816_R0.dat TestFiles/GEOMS-LIDAR-O3-005-redacted.txt

Nb: the pressure and temperatures are 1d vectors in this output
It is optimized for curtains, not for a single profile

If a single profile is used the GEOMS file may be modified from :  
VAR_NAME = O3.MIXING.RATIO.VOLUME_DERIVED
...
VAR_DEPEND = DATETIME;ALTITUDE
to: 
VAR_NAME = O3.MIXING.RATIO.VOLUME_DERIVED
...
VAR_DEPEND = ALTITUDE

for all the VAR_NAME that correspond to the curtain.

WARNING: be sure to delete the output file if re-launching the conversion. Otherwise the inputs of the second run will be added.
