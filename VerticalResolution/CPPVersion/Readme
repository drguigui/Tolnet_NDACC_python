TOLNET/NDACC Vertical resolution algorithm in C++. 

The standalone algorithm are in:
resolutiondf.cpp
resolutionir.cpp
the main function does a simple example of resolution computation.



The comparison of the C++ version of the algorithm against Dr. T. Leblanc (JPL) IDL version is found in:
analyzeall.cpp


Tested with g++.
Compilation/use example:
g++ anlyzeall.cpp
./a.out
